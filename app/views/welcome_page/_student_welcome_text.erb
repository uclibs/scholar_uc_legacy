<p>Scholar@UC is a digital repository that enables the University of Cincinnati community to share research and scholarly work with a worldwide audience and preserve it for the future. It provides free access to material written, produced, and researched by the UC community. Read more about the mission of Scholar@UC on the <a href="/about_request">About page</a>.

<h3 id="how-can-students-use-scholaruc">How can students use Scholar@UC?</h3>
<p>Although only faculty and staff can submit content to Scholar@UC at this time, students can log in and view material in the repository for research or classroom work. Scholar@UC is constantly growing and includes information like published articles, photographs, manuscripts, datasets, posters and much more.</p>

<p>In order to share scholarly output and creative works like capstone projects, students should work with a faculty member or advisor. Graduate students should continue to work with the <a href="http://grad.uc.edu/student-life/etd.html">Graduate School</a> for submission of electronic theses and dissertations.</p>
